Grunt grunt! <span class="more"></span>

The area I'm working on now, basically filling out the parents section and adding forms to all of my models, is brute work. And I find that it needs long, extended periods of time.

Sometimes, cutting yourself off with an arbitrary time limit of 1-2 hours can prove to be counter-intuitive, as it has the penalty of having to get back on track in your next session.

Everything is moving forward, slowly, but I'm planning to try and commit a good chunk of time, 4-8 hours, when I have more free time to really get some of the brute work out of the way.

## Bonus

I also wrote a little experiment in React to [show a set of traffic lights.](http://codepen.io/gpmcadam/pen/RrGYjR) No real reason.
