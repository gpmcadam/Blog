Too much time spent farting around trying to understand topics associated with React. Search terms today include: flux, reflux, react+backbone, backbone es6, backbone router es6, backbone react browserify ... etc. etc.

Taking on too much? Need to commit more time than I have in an evening to properly understanding Flux and how to integrate it with React and maybe Backbone. Maybe I'll just delete everything and start again?

Everyone has an opinion on how to do this, the community is chaotic right now. There's a solution in here somewhere, and I can taste it. The key will be understanding Flux, I feel.
