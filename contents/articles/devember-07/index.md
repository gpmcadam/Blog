I've logged 12 hours so far over 7 days. So far it's gone OK and I'm more happy with what I've learned in this time than the results I've been able to produce.

I feel like I've gone from knowing only very little about React &ndash; and next to nothing about Gulp, Babel, Browserify and ES6 &ndash; and now I've got a good hold on the basics and a structure for a demo for this web app.

We're just under 1/4 of the way through Devember and I feel like the next 7 days will be telling in terms of how quickly I'm hoping to get a fully working prototype of the app. I may have to sacrifice some functionality to get there.

Today I spent some time polishing the UI of the landing page and introducing some animation with the awesome [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) project. Tomorrow, I'm going to hopefully spend some time investigating routing options for a single page app in React. I've looked very briefly at [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) but I'm not 100% sure if it's what I need. Needs more thought!

## Today's Observations

 - Odd hours meant I lost a github streak that would've lasted 31 days hopefully `:(`
 - The differences between SASS and LESS (other than syntax) aren't that obvious to me yet, although compile time seems a lot quicker (anecdotally). Still waiting to discover the "killer feature" which separates the two.
 - Stats for today: 1 commit, time spent 1h 37m 32s
