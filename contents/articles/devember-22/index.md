Fun fun fun.<span class="more"></span> Slow evening. Spent most of the day doing some last minute Christmas shopping, and then spent some time just focusing on some of the smaller things to do with the UI.

I'm &ndash; strangely &ndash; enjoying splitting out some of my requirements into sub-components. There's a danger of abstracting too much, I suppose (mostly in terms of consuming time versus delivering the prototype.) It's probably going to be Saturday/Sunday before I begin focusing some larger blocks of time per night to get this ready. But it's coming together.

Also, today was my last day in work until the new year. So ... yay.
