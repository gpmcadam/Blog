Hallway testing today.<span class="more"></span> I managed to complete a simple version of the add profile form, and I brought with it some bad habits from my understanding of web forms.

After a brief chat with my (patient) wife regarding what *her* expectations and opions on how the form might behave, I learned a few things which I think will postivively impact the design of the admin seciton.

Just a 5 minute chat while demoing the functionality has probably saved some later frustration, and shows the value of hallway testing.

Otherwise, very tired. Going to bed.
