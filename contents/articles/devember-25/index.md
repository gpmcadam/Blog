\**bangs head on table*\*.<span class="more"></span> I've just been fighting with small bits and pieces this evening, and getting distracted with browsing StackOverflow and chatting on the reactjs IRC channel.

Anyway, since it's Christmas day, I haven't had alot of opportunity. Unfortunately, after an hour and a half of programming my code isn't running and I don't have the patience to find out why, so I'm heading to bed. Will fix tomorrow.

Merry Christmas, everyone! :)
