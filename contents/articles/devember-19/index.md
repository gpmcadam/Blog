I fixed the player! <span class="more"></span>

Yay!

Oh, and I also wrote my database models, updated my migrations to match the changes since the initial set of migrations were written, and seeded the database with some real-ish data. Now the app is serving out from the database!

Next up:

  - Parent Interface (fill the database with real values)
  - Authentication (yeah, leaving that until last)
  - Hallway testing!
