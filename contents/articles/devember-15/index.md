Half-way there!<span class="more"></span> However after a long night, I've found myself too tired to complete what I'm working on (the unfortunately tedius task of skinning a Video.js player interface).

Maybe with some sleep and a bit more energy I'll find myself with more enthusiasm for the task tomorrow!

We'll see!

## Today's Observations

 - About half way until the end of Devember, and I feel like I'm about half way towards a working prototype. I'm hoping to begin some user testing later this week with my 2-year old daughter!
 - The majority of the rest of the month will likely focus on improvements to the UI and writing the parent interface.
 - Stats for today: 0 commits, time spent: 27m 20s
