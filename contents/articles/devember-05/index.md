Checking in from a hotel, still managed to get some stuff done! <span class="more"></span>

After a night out drinking with a client from work, I wasn't sure how functional I'd be (I have another family-related festive social gathering tomorrow so I've tried to stay as un-drunk as I can in anticipation of that).

However, I've managed to stay awake and bring my laptop along to the hotel we're staying at to check in.

Not a very productive hour, touching up some of the UI and mostly waiting for my gulp tasks to run (30s per run now) &ndash; tomorrow's priority will *have* to be to investigate making 
this more efficient!

## Today's Observations

 - Pizza + Beer + Coding = Fun! Someone should do this with more coordination on a larger scale...
 - Premier Inn offer a free WiFi but it's limited to 20 KB/s down, conveniently there's an unlimited version of the exact same WiFi available for Â£5 for 24 hrs. Robbery. [#firstworldproblems](http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/)
