Quiet evening, *again!*<span class="more"></span>

My issues with the player component come from the destructive nature of VideoJS and the component life-cycle in ReactJS.

I feel I'm close to a solution but I've only been able to commit about an hour tonight after a busy schedule.

The blog, however, I spent a few hours on since I wanted to test out a continuous integration system. I went with [Travis](http://travis-ci.org) in the end, and the blog is now publishing to Amazon S3 automatically upon commit! It's something else I've failed to get up to speed on, and I'm glad I was able to during Devember. I intend to put up a more detailed post on Travis towards the end of the month.

I'll also be looking at solutions that integrate with BitBucket, too.

*Tomorrow I'll fix the player. Tomorrow I'll fix the player. Tomorrow I'll fix the player. Tomorrow I'll fix the player. Tomorrow I'll fix the player. Tomorrow I'll fix the player. Tomorrow I'll fix the player. Tomorrow I'll fix the player...*
