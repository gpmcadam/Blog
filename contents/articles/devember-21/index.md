Ugh.<span class="more"></span> Not felt great today! Still managed to get about an hour in this evening after a nap and then some Christmas shopping courtesy of Amazon Prime One-Day Delivery.

Nothing of interest to note this evening, except that react-bootstrap is a *huge* timesaver which I'm sad to only just discover. Makes me think there should be something similar available in PHP/Laravel.
