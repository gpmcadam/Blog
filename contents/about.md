</span> **Hello, I'm Gary!**

I'm a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.

I'm also somewhat active on [other social things](https://twitter.com/gpmcadam), too &ndash; but don't hold it against me! (*I try to be nice to others most of the time.*)

You can view some of the things I've worked on on [that social coding place everyone raves about.](https://github.com/gpmcadam)

I sometimes post photographs [on that other one](http://instagram.com/gpmcadam), aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on [that one you always use to do your homework.](http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam)
