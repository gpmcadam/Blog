<p>I’ve been able to use it a little more tonight. I’ve been aware of it for a while and have tinkered with it, but today I’ve tried to delve a little deeper into it. It was a breeze to set up a responsive “full screen” player interface with just a few <span class="caps">CSS</span>&nbsp;properties.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it’s just me but I find the naming conventions a little dense and I feel it’ll take a while to properly master it (as with all things presentation with&nbsp;<span class="caps">HTML</span>/CSS!)</p>
<p>I also played around with <a href="http://videojs.com/">VideoJS</a> today and I’m looking forward to integrating with this player for serving out my videos. There’s a plugin called <a href="https://github.com/eXon/videojs-youtube">videojs-youtube</a> which handles playing of external videos. Provided I can get this set up, hopefully I’ll not have to touch the YouTube <span class="caps">API</span> itself (except for the data API for search later on) and maybe have a bit more control over how I display&nbsp;videos.</p>

<p>We’ll&nbsp;see!</p>
<h2 id="today-s-observations">Today’s&nbsp;Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>About 1 week now until I break for Christmas. This usually means a last minute rush at work to get everything prepared for when I’m not there, hopefully I’m still able to get an hour or two&nbsp;in.</li>
<li>Being off work for a while should (in theory) give me a lot more time to work on the project. However, I’m hoping to not be spending every day of my vacation programming, so still aiming for 1-2 hrs per&nbsp;day!</li>
<li>Days I’m thinking will be a challenge: Xmas Day, New Years Eve, New Years Day. We’ll see how it&nbsp;goes!</li>
<li>Stats for today: 1 commit, time spent: 2h 8m&nbsp;29s</li>

</span> <strong>Hello, I’m Gary!</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.</p>
<p>I’m also somewhat active on <a href="https://twitter.com/gpmcadam">other social things</a>, too &ndash; but don’t hold it against me! (<em>I try to be nice to others most of the time.</em>)</p>
<p>You can view some of the things I’ve worked on on <a href="https://github.com/gpmcadam">that social coding place everyone raves about.</a></p>
<p>I sometimes post photographs <a href="http://instagram.com/gpmcadam">on that other one</a>, aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam">that one you always use to do your homework.</a></p>
