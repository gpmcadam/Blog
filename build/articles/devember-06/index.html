<p><em>Woo!</em></p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span> so 8s still isn’t ideal. But it’s a lot better than 30. I can deal with that right&nbsp;now.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-watchify">Introducing&nbsp;Watchify</h2>
<p>After some digging, it turns out that the creators of Browserify, in realizing how slow Browserify can be, released <a href="https://github.com/substack/watchify">Watchify</a> which helps to speed up the process… go&nbsp;figure.</p>
<p>My gulp file is now a mess, so I’m going to investigate some ways to clean it up by writing my tasks as modules &ndash; but that’s enough fiddling with gulp for now, the current gulp file should do for now as I’m hoping to get back to the actual job tomorrow&nbsp;evening.</p>
<h2 id="today-s-observations">Today’s&nbsp;Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The auxiliary stuff surrounding development, such as setting up task runners and debugging them, tweaking them, is in my opinion the most tedious aspect of the job. I wish I could just remove it&nbsp;entirely.</li>
<li>Stats for today: 1 commit, time spent 1h 20m&nbsp;31s</li>

</span> <strong>Hello, I’m Gary!</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.</p>
<p>I’m also somewhat active on <a href="https://twitter.com/gpmcadam">other social things</a>, too &ndash; but don’t hold it against me! (<em>I try to be nice to others most of the time.</em>)</p>
<p>You can view some of the things I’ve worked on on <a href="https://github.com/gpmcadam">that social coding place everyone raves about.</a></p>
<p>I sometimes post photographs <a href="http://instagram.com/gpmcadam">on that other one</a>, aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam">that one you always use to do your homework.</a></p>
