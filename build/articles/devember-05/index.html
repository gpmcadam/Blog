<p>After a night out drinking with a client from work, I wasn’t sure how functional I’d be (I have another family-related festive social gathering tomorrow so I’ve tried to stay as un-drunk as I can in anticipation of&nbsp;that).</p>
<p>However, I’ve managed to stay awake and bring my laptop along to the hotel we’re staying at to check&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Not a very productive hour, touching up some of the <span class="caps">UI</span> and mostly waiting for my gulp tasks to run (30s per run now) &ndash; tomorrow’s priority will <em>have</em> to be to investigate making 
this more&nbsp;efficient!</p>

<h2 id="today-s-observations">Today’s&nbsp;Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pizza + Beer + Coding = Fun! Someone should do this with more coordination on a larger&nbsp;scale…</li>
<li>Premier Inn offer a free WiFi but it’s limited to 20 <span class="caps">KB</span>/s down, conveniently there’s an unlimited version of the exact same WiFi available for £5 for 24 hrs. Robbery. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/">#firstworldproblems</a></li>
<li>Stats for today: 1 commit, time spent 48&nbsp;mins</li>

</span> <strong>Hello, I’m Gary!</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.</p>
<p>I’m also somewhat active on <a href="https://twitter.com/gpmcadam">other social things</a>, too &ndash; but don’t hold it against me! (<em>I try to be nice to others most of the time.</em>)</p>
<p>You can view some of the things I’ve worked on on <a href="https://github.com/gpmcadam">that social coding place everyone raves about.</a></p>
<p>I sometimes post photographs <a href="http://instagram.com/gpmcadam">on that other one</a>, aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam">that one you always use to do your homework.</a></p>
