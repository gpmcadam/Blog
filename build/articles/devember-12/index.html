<p>However, finally, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html">Flux</a> makes sense!
After spending another few hours tonight
watching <a href="https://egghead.io/series/react-flux-architecture-es6">a great course on egghead.io</a>,
I’ve come out understanding the Flux architecture in a lot more&nbsp;detail!</p>
<p>This is exactly what I was talking about when I was pining for more structure and an imposed
set of rules in React. The downside here though is that there are a lot of ways to interpret
the Flux architecture, and there’s a lot of frameworks written around&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I’m sure in the future the community will settle around a few big ideas. For now, I’m settling
with a fairly bog-standard Flux architecture using Facebook’s <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux/">flux</a>&nbsp;package.</p>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>After investigating Backbone and Page.js, it seemed obvious to me that
<a href="https://github.com/rackt/react-router">react-router</a> is the
better choice. Anything else includes a lot of rewriting of stuff that’s already been well
thought out, particularly around component&nbsp;re-rendering.</p>
<h2 id="onwards-again-">Onwards …&nbsp;again!?</h2>
<p>I feel like I’ve got a far better organised and more stable architecture to move on with now.
I don’t anticipate any big changes to the structure until the first prototype is&nbsp;complete.</p>
<p>So next, it’ll be fleshing out the rest of the pages and including&nbsp;functionality.</p>

</span> <strong>Hello, I’m Gary!</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.</p>
<p>I’m also somewhat active on <a href="https://twitter.com/gpmcadam">other social things</a>, too &ndash; but don’t hold it against me! (<em>I try to be nice to others most of the time.</em>)</p>
<p>You can view some of the things I’ve worked on on <a href="https://github.com/gpmcadam">that social coding place everyone raves about.</a></p>
<p>I sometimes post photographs <a href="http://instagram.com/gpmcadam">on that other one</a>, aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam">that one you always use to do your homework.</a></p>
