<p>So, that’s it! All done. I made it to the other side! A full month of Development complete. It’s over.&nbsp;Phew!</p>
<div class="img-responsive img-lg">

</div>

<p>Well, today’s post will be like no other, I’ll be summing up <em>just today’s findings</em> &ndash; but, I’m planning to write a big follow-up post in the next few days to summarise my thoughts on the project, the next steps, Devember, some of the tools I’ve used and a few other&nbsp;bits!</p>
<p>So, what have I been up to this New Year’s Eve?&nbsp;…</p>
<h2 id="-s-moving-s-upgrading-from-lumen-to-laravel"><s>Moving</s> Upgrading from Lumen to&nbsp;Laravel</h2>
<p>I decided, in order to resolve a few things that I had on my list today, that the best thing would be to say goodbye to Lumen and move to its more mature older brother,&nbsp;Laravel.</p>
<p>My reasoning for this is simple: I don’t know what Lumen exists for. Laravel is, maybe just for my needs, just as quick and has just the same kind of footprint on disk (from an organisational&nbsp;standpoint).</p>
<p>So, given that Lumen lacks a lot of the features, but doesn’t really bring anything else to the table, I decide to move to&nbsp;Laravel.</p>
<p>This process wasn’t straightforward, and was mostly manual, involving creating a new Laravel project and manually moving my <code>resources/</code>, <code>public/</code>, <code>app/Http/</code>, etc. folders on top of the Laravel&nbsp;ones.</p>
<h2 id="testing-the-api">Testing the&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span></h2>
<p>I set up some very simple unit tests to ensure that my <span class="caps">API</span> was working. I still need to come up with a way to get coverage on the destructive API methods, such as <code>create</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>destroy</code>. Until then, I’ve got <em>some</em> coverage as a simple sanity check to make sure that everything looks&nbsp;<span class="caps">OK</span>.</p>
<p>This is made very easy by using the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/testing">Laravel test</a> frameworks <code>seeJsonStructure</code> method. So, if my <span class="caps">API</span> returns some JSON like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/playlists/6

{
  &quot;playlist&quot;: {
    &quot;id&quot;: 6,
    &quot;profile_id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Hey Duggee &quot;,
    &quot;img&quot;: &quot;/img/playlists/72cdbc27931177b9dd1be93b232b9e240bd4a50c.jpg&quot;,
    &quot;bg&quot;: &quot;#63CD61&quot;,
    &quot;fg&quot;: &quot;#FFCC01&quot;,
    &quot;created_at&quot;: &quot;2015-12-30 03:57:51&quot;,
    &quot;updated_at&quot;: &quot;2015-12-31 04:49:06&quot;,
    &quot;items&quot;: [
      ...
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre><p>I can assert that the <span class="caps">API</span> is working with a simple test case as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<pre><code>public function testPlaylist()
{
    $this-&gt;get(&#39;/api/playlists/6&#39;)
        -&gt;seeJsonStructure([&#39;playlist&#39; =&gt; [ &#39;id&#39; ]]);
}
</code></pre><p>This test ensures that the <span class="caps">JSON</span> returned has the <code>playlist</code> object, and that it has an <code>id</code> column.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I said, I will be giving a bigger summary later this week, but it should be said that <a href="http://devember.org/">Devember</a> for me has been amazing! I’m thankful for taking part and it’s been one of the most enjoyable and rewarding months of programming in a long time. So thanks to everyone <a href="https://twitter.com/joindevember">at Devember</a> for organising&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="today-s-observations">Today’s&nbsp;Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maybe thankfully, my plans for New Year fell through this evening, and it gave me all night (between spending time with my family and observing the goings on elsewhere on <span class="caps">TV</span>) to commit some time to finishing up a few things for my final Devember&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>Stats for today: 1 commit, 1 branch, 6h 1m&nbsp;54s</li>

</span> <strong>Hello, I’m Gary!</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.</p>
<p>I’m also somewhat active on <a href="https://twitter.com/gpmcadam">other social things</a>, too &ndash; but don’t hold it against me! (<em>I try to be nice to others most of the time.</em>)</p>
<p>You can view some of the things I’ve worked on on <a href="https://github.com/gpmcadam">that social coding place everyone raves about.</a></p>
<p>I sometimes post photographs <a href="http://instagram.com/gpmcadam">on that other one</a>, aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam">that one you always use to do your homework.</a></p>
