spending some time getting to grips with the details of React, but I’ve
managed to add some&nbsp;complexity.</p>
<p>I’ve also expanded on my gulpfile, learned more about gulp in general
and spent a lot of time watching my stuff build &ndash; Browserify can take
a while to&nbsp;build!</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward-with-react">Moving Forward with&nbsp;React</h2>
<p>I’ve now managed to get a bit further with React, and I’m starting to
generate a slightly more complicated structure to my app. I now have 6-7
components and I’m doing some re-rendering based on&nbsp;events.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this is the best way to handle the process, or I should simply
let the browser redraw the page. This is something I’ll experiment with going&nbsp;forward.</p>
<h2 id="gulp-newer-vs-gulp-changed">gulp-newer vs&nbsp;gulp-changed</h2>
<p>As someone who always preferred using <code>grunt-newer</code> for my build processes,
moving to gulp was tricky. The community seems to prefer watch&nbsp;tasks.</p>
<p>After comparing two packages, <strong>gulp-newer</strong> and <strong>gulp-changed</strong>, I’ve
settled on <strong>gulp-newer</strong> as it allows you to check both 1:1 and many:1&nbsp;differences.</p>
<h2 id="gulp-build-time-with-browserify">Gulp Build Time with&nbsp;Browserify</h2>
<p>I’m still struggling with a very very slow build time, around ~25s per&nbsp;build.</p>
<p>This is due to the bundling of all files with Browserify, so I’m going to
investigate how to lower this down. Thankfully using <strong>gulp-newer</strong> means this
will only run on any changes to my React, but still, it’s&nbsp;clumsy.</p>
<p>Also, as an aside, I need to figure out how to properly pipe Browserify through
gulp, as my build output claims that gulp has finished compiling my <span class="caps">JS</span> before
Browserify actually starts. Bit&nbsp;odd.</p>
<h2 id="today-s-observations">Today’s&nbsp;Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="caps">DEVEMBER</span> BONUS!</strong> I’ve spent some extra time this evening writing a small utility 
to help <a href="/articles/vagrant-up">manage vagrant machines a little&nbsp;better</a></li>
<li>Busy weekend planned, I’m going to try and get Day 5 done before going out, otherwise
I guess I’m taking my laptop with me for some alcohol induced&nbsp;coding!</li>
<li>Stats for today: 1 commit, time spent 2h 57m&nbsp;18s</li>

</span> <strong>Hello, I’m Gary!</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.</p>
<p>I’m also somewhat active on <a href="https://twitter.com/gpmcadam">other social things</a>, too &ndash; but don’t hold it against me! (<em>I try to be nice to others most of the time.</em>)</p>
<p>You can view some of the things I’ve worked on on <a href="https://github.com/gpmcadam">that social coding place everyone raves about.</a></p>
<p>I sometimes post photographs <a href="http://instagram.com/gpmcadam">on that other one</a>, aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam">that one you always use to do your homework.</a></p>
