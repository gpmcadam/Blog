<p>That’s how I feel right now,&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>I’m a huge fan of ReactJS and I’ve been desperate to use it on a project
for ages. Unfortunately ReactJS and its community are moving so
quickly that they haven’t stopped to document things properly
and because of how quick it’s changing, any community guides are already&nbsp;outdated.</p>
<p>Tonight consisted of swapping and hacking between various combinations of
grunt, gulp, webpack, browserify, babel and react. I’m still not sure
what the best combination is &ndash; nor that any of the above is even required
(seriously why is it so hard to get the default Hello World running using the
suggested method of <code>babel-cli</code>?!)</p>
<p>I’ve finally got everything running with the help of a friendly user in the
React <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel. But I’m a little dissuaded&nbsp;already.</p>
<p>Sometimes there’s a comfort in being given a strict set of tools, and I wonder
if React needs time to settle on a way of pre-compilation. Right now it’s a bit
of a&nbsp;minefield.</p>
<p>Anyway after many hours of frustration, I’ve ended up with a combination&nbsp;of:</p>
<ul>
<li>gulp</li>
<li>babel</li>
<li>babelify</li>
<li>browserify</li>
<li>react (+&nbsp;react-dom)</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m still getting to grips with what everything is, but it’s a real shame
to spend the evening bashing your head against the wall just trying to
get some JavaScript to&nbsp;pre-compile.</p>
<p>For now, it’s rendering. So while I have 0 commits, I’m happy enough that
tomorrow at least I’ll get to write a line of code (hopefully!) or maybe
I’ll distract myself by implementing some of the <span class="caps">UI</span>&nbsp;instead.</p>
<h2 id="today-s-observations">Today’s&nbsp;Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>At the start of this project I decided to test out Atom. I had previously
been using Sublime Text 3 (which I use full time otherwise). My summary:
it’s a great idea and an amazing achievement, but I’m not sure it’s ready
to be used generally. I’ll revisit this editor in the future, but even for
this small side project, it’s not up to the task.

</span> <strong>Hello, I’m Gary!</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.</p>
<p>I’m also somewhat active on <a href="https://twitter.com/gpmcadam">other social things</a>, too &ndash; but don’t hold it against me! (<em>I try to be nice to others most of the time.</em>)</p>
<p>You can view some of the things I’ve worked on on <a href="https://github.com/gpmcadam">that social coding place everyone raves about.</a></p>
<p>I sometimes post photographs <a href="http://instagram.com/gpmcadam">on that other one</a>, aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam">that one you always use to do your homework.</a></p>
