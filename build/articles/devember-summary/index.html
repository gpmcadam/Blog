    <em>This is my #Devember</em>
</div>

<p>I succeeded (to some degree; there were some nights I couldn’t commit to fully) and came out on the this side of the month with a working prototype for an app called Bloon, a child-friendly YouTube&nbsp;player.</p>
<p>I chose to write the app using React, something which I had no previous experience with. Here’s my summary of #Devember, React, other technologies I encountered along the way &ndash; and what’s next for Bloon, devblogging and my projects in&nbsp;general.</p>
<h2 id="devember">Devember</h2>
<p>I touched on it in the <a href="/articles/devember-31">previous post</a>, but I’ll reiterate it: #Devember was massively rewarding. The idea isn’t new or exclusive to the month of December. Also my day job <em>is</em> programming, so the idea of writing code pretty much daily isn’t the revolutionary aspect &ndash; although it’s worth noting that it’s difficult to find time and energy to write code <em>every single day</em> including weekends, especially with other commitments. And on at least two occasions, I wasn’t able to write a line of&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>The biggest thing<sup>[1]</sup> that kept me going was the idea devblogging in general, something I hadn’t done before. Even though I knew it was without an audience, there’s still a level of commitment, you don’t want to stop posting after you’ve publicly vowed to do an hour a day at&nbsp;least.</p>
<p>And for that reason, I found a new way to avoid procrastination. This is also helped by only coding in short bursts and of course being able to work on something you thought up, and so your motivation is still pretty high. But still, on those days when you’re extra tired, maybe a little drunk or otherwise distracted, you still have to write that blog post. And you still have to make a commit. So, yeah, some days are not as productive and the quality of the code isn’t as good, but still, you make a&nbsp;commit.</p>
<p>Blogging every night also keeps you focused and helps you plan your next step &ndash; similar to the benefits of standup meetings. Or in my case, decide what you’re going to drop because you realise there isn’t enough time. And some features <em>did</em> get jettisoned part-way though, but I was able to deliver the prototype I wanted to from day one,&nbsp;more-or-less.</p>
<p>Here’s some stats from my&nbsp;journey:</p>

<p><sup>1. The other big motivating factor was watching my commit streak on GitHub grow, however I was only really able to achieve a 13-day maximum streak in the entire period, simply because I would go 24 hours without coding in some cases (committing my work at 2am the next morning, on most&ndash;but not all&ndash; nights)</sup></p>
<h2 id="individual-technology-thoughts">Individual Technology&nbsp;Thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="gulp-vs-grunt">Gulp vs&nbsp;Grunt</h3>
<ul>
<li>I use Grunt in my day job, but Gulp was chosen for this&nbsp;project</li>
<li>Gulp seems faster, but Grunt fits my workflow more &ndash; will probably go with Gulp and seek tools that meet my&nbsp;workflow</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lumen-laravel">Lumen/Laravel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lumen is pointless for me, Laravel is superior &ndash; even as a microframework &ndash; however I should have used a much lighter framework for knocking up APIs than what I went with (maybe something Node&nbsp;based)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="react">React</h3>
<ul>
<li>No previous experience with React, and my first week was spent banging my head against the desk trying to understand React, the tutorials and documentation, the community suggestions, Flux (and associated frameworks) and other&nbsp;topics.</li>
<li>However, I’m <em>so</em> glad to have found it, will explore it in more detail on other projects I hope &ndash; next up: React&nbsp;Native</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="react-bootstrap">React-Bootstrap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Huge time saver, can’t wait for it to update to Bootstrap&nbsp;4</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sass-vs-less">Sass vs&nbsp;Less</h3>
<ul>
<li>Again, I use Less in my day job but chose Sass for this&nbsp;project</li>
<li>Not that much difference for me, similar features available in both. Would be happy to use either, although do prefer syntax of&nbsp;<span class="caps">LESS</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="browserify-and-es6">Browserify and&nbsp;<span class="caps">ES6</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Browserify is great and I’m glad to get some experience in&nbsp;<span class="caps">ES6</span></li>
<li>Love the <span class="caps">ES6</span> features and hope I can keep on using them in other&nbsp;projects</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safari-mobile-web-apps">Safari Mobile Web&nbsp;Apps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not worth bothering with! Too slow, too restrictive and not customisable enough - native apps are the clear winners and Apple clearly wants to keep it this&nbsp;way</li>
<li>With that said I was able to launch a working prototype in ~<script>document.write((totalTime/60).toFixed())</script><noscript>59</noscript> hours, which can be useful, especially for the purpose of designing the&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What’s&nbsp;Next?</h2>
<ul>
<li>For Bloon, a native (or hybrid) app. Will look at making the <span class="caps">API</span> quicker and making some smaller changes to the front-end for the short&nbsp;term</li>
<li>The ultimate goal is to release the app to market by&nbsp;June/July</li>
<li>Will I continue to code an extra 1 hour (or more) per day? Maybe on average, but I won’t be forcing myself to a daily commitment like I have been. However, I will try and do 1 devblog per week to keep my motivation&nbsp;up.</li>
<li>One thing’s for sure, I’ll be keeping up with <span class="caps">ES6</span>+Browserify+React as that is the most existing thing to come out of this entire thing for&nbsp;me.</li>
</ul>

</span> <strong>Hello, I’m Gary!</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a web developer, designer and training systems architect living on a hill in Yorkshire with my wife, daughter and two cats.</p>
<p>I’m also somewhat active on <a href="https://twitter.com/gpmcadam">other social things</a>, too &ndash; but don’t hold it against me! (<em>I try to be nice to others most of the time.</em>)</p>
<p>You can view some of the things I’ve worked on on <a href="https://github.com/gpmcadam">that social coding place everyone raves about.</a></p>
<p>I sometimes post photographs <a href="http://instagram.com/gpmcadam">on that other one</a>, aswell. And from time to time I try to help people with their programming on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/171758/gpmcadam">that one you always use to do your homework.</a></p>
